# Workgroup_Interpolation
This repository is meant to hold all of the processing and analysis code for the CEI Preprocessing Interpolation workgroup

## Guidlines
-When developing or working on code, do so on a branch and create pull requests before merging into master. Request review of the merge if conflicts are present or the changes are major.

-When a branch is no longer necessary, delete it

-**NO DATA or Binary Files** should be uploaded to the repository if they will be written to or changed often, they are costly to store and we have limited large file storage
